## Overview
  Analysis was performed on citibike data from August in New York City to help investors determine if a similar bike share program would be viable in Des Moines, IA. The analysis will be used to complete a proposal for how a similar bike share program will function in a new city. Citibike data for the month of August was downlaoded in CSV format from their webiste. Pandas was then used to transform the "tripduration" column into a datetime datatype. A new CSV with the converted column was exported to create visualizations needed for the proposal.

## Results
  For NYC Citibike data, there are definite trends on the types of users as well as when and where bikes are being used. 
  ### 1) Types of users
 A majority (65%) of citibike users are male. Most users (81%) are subscribers, or people who have purchased an annual pass instead of a day pass.
