## Overview
  Analysis was performed on citibike data from August in New York City to help investors determine if a similar bike share program would be viable in Des Moines, IA. The analysis will be used to complete a proposal for how a similar bike share program will function in a new city. Citibike data for the month of August was downlaoded in CSV format from their webiste. Pandas was then used to transform the "tripduration" column into a datetime datatype. A new CSV with the converted column was exported to create visualizations needed for the proposal.
